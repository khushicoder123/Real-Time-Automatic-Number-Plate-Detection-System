## models

A Yolov8 pretrained model was used to detect vehicles.
A licensed plate detector was used to detect license plates.  
The trained model is available in my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ComputerVisionEngineer).

## dependencies

The sort module needs to be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/abewley/sort) as mentioned in the [video](https://youtu.be/fyJB1t0o0ms?t=1120).

To run this on you local system download the zip file or push the repo to your local system. Add the virtual enviornment using python -m venv venv. Start the virtual enviornment using venv\Scripts\activate
. Then run command "python app.py".
